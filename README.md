# Dockerfiles

Dockerfiles that ships with dependencies for running Vapor projects (including [CStack](https://github.com/nodes-vapor/cstack)). These images are used in [our Circle CI scripts](https://github.com/nodes-vapor/readme/tree/master/Configuration/.circleci).

## Updating the docker images

Currently we have two images:

- `Dockerfile-Swift3` which is supposed to be used for Vapor 1 projects. The image is pushed to [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/brettrtoomey/vapor1-ci/).
- `Dockerfile-Swift4` which is supposed to be used for Vapor 2 projects. The image is pushed to [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/brettrtoomey/vapor-ci/)

A guide for building new images based on dockerfiles can be found [here](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/custom-images/).
